# Evil in Jaffar

<p align="center">
Lies and deceit shall fall short,<br/>  
When the real knight will come forth,<br/>  
Born from a broken promise,<br/>  
He must keep his all,<br/>  
To save the world from it's biggest fall<br/>
<br/> 
 
</p>


## Introduction

When the abode of heaven was created by the forces of good, a prophecy was made that an evil power will control the world as long as the angel of good doesn't intervene. 

Evil King of Jaffar is the greatest known servant of evil spirits to exist in the world who wants to rule the world using the eternal fire of dark power.

You are the Prince of Yemen born to defeat the Evil King of Jaffar and fulfill the prophecy of the heavens.

For this, you must set off on a journey to distant lands and clear each Quest to defeat the EVIL IN JAFFAR!

## Instructions
Clear the 3 quests in the game by battling 3 different villains, the last one being the King of Jaffar. Each level gets harder by making the villain faster and harder to kill. Free your kingdom! 

## Controls
 - _Mouse_: Click once to attack, click twice to block
 - _"w"_: Press "w" to jump
 - _Arrow keys__: Use these to move your knight

## Deployment
 - https://evil-in-jaffar.netlify.app/

## Game Engine:
 - Unity 
 
 ## Inspiration
- We wanted to implement a fantasy based game with magnificient characters so we came up with a medieval age storyline and characters for this game.

## What it does
- It is a 2D fantasy RPG batlle game in which the user is the main protagonist of the game who has to clear 3 quests in order to complete the game.
- The game story is based on the Prince of Yemen who has to defeat the Evil king of Jaffar and fulfill the prophecy of heaven by completing all the quests.
- Each quests is difficult than the previous quest with health bar and only one life for each character.
- Controls of the game are as follows : Mouse: Click once to attack, click twice to block, "w": Press "w" to jump and Arrow keys_: Use these to move your knight

## How we built it
- We built it on unity with first coming up with a storyline. We then decided on different levels to implement and chose the main characters for the game. After the levels were finalized we then worked on adding transitions, introduction and sound effects to the game. In the end we finally worked on the deployment of the game.

## Challenges I ran into
- Unity had a bit of learning curve so it was difficult to get started with it.
- Coming up with a game idea with so much to choose from and implement them from scratch was quite a challenge itself. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- We are really proud that we were able to build a full fledged RPG battle game from scratch without any prior knowledge of Unity.


## What we learned
- How to get started with Unity
- What all things are required to make a game
- How to animate characters in Unity
- How to add sound effects and transitions in Unity

## What's next for Evil in Jaffar
- Add more levels to the game
- Improve upon the graphics of the game 
- Improve the storyline of the game
